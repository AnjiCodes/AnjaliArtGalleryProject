# ---- AnjaliArtGalleryProject ----

# Motivation/Objective 
I created this project for my School Project which is called "Passion Project" for my 2nd Semester and I decided to make a Web app for "Image upload" like Gallery in our Phones, or Google Photos. In this app, the user can have the space where they can check out the list of Albums which stores the images and further, can check image details and can edit or delete the image details which is basically CRUD Operations for Image table.
# Build Status 
The current status is that the CRUD Operation for Image Table works Completely but there is only a List of Albums which is Technically READ Operation only and it is the same for the Style table as well.
# Code Style
There is no particular code style but I've used WEB API Entity Framework and MVC read/write actions instead of MCV Entity Framework. 
# Tech/Framework used
1. ASP.NET Developer platform
2. C# language
3. MVC Design pattern for CRUD Operations
# Features
The main feature of this app is Image upload which is done with the method by storing the ImageData with data type Byte[] and then saving and reading it in the controller in Bytes(int) but then converting it again and retrieving it in the View to display it using <img src> tag
# How to use it? 
In the Nav bar, by Clicking on the Album to access the Image list where the user can perform the CRUD operations.
