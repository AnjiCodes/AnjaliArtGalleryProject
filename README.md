# ----------------- Motivation/Objective -----------------
# I created this project for my School Project which is called "Passion Project" for my 2nd Semester and I decided to make a Web app for "Image upload" like Gallery in our Phones, or Google Photos. In this app, the user can check out the list of Albums which stores the images and further, can check image details.
